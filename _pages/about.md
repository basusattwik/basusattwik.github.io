I am a Ph.D. student in [ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). I am advised by Professor [Romit Roy Choudhury](http://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu) in the [Signals and Inference Research Group (SiNRG)](https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu). 

My research focuses on deep generative models and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, with an emphasis on inverse problems using diffusion priors.

Previously, I worked an Audio DSP Engineer at [HARMAN](https://www.harman.com). I received my M.S. in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/) from the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu) and my B.Tech in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from [SRM University, India](https://www.srmist.edu.in). 

Outside research, I play classical piano and have studied at the [Eastman School of Music, Community Center](https://www.esm.rochester.edu/community/) and [K.M. Music Conservatory, India](https://www.kmmc.in).
