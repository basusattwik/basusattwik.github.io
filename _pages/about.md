Hi! I am an electrical engineer specializing in Signal Processing and Machine Learning applied to audio and music data. 

I currently work as a Senior Audio DSP Engineer at [HARMAN](https://www.harman.com) and have contributed towards the research and development of multiple audio algorithms for applications in [Car Audio](https://car.harman.com/solutions/car-audio) systems. 

Prior to joining HARMAN, I earned my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu) with a concentration in Musical Acoustics and Signal Processing.

In August, I will start my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ece.illinois.edu) under the supervision of Professor [Romit Roy Choudhury](http://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu) as a member of [SyNRG](https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu). My research goal is to solve challenging problems in the field of Computational Audio and Signal Processing. 

I play classical piano and guitar and have studied at the [Eastman School of Music, Community Center](https://www.esm.rochester.edu/community/) and [K.M. Music Conservatory, Chennai](https://www.kmmc.in).
