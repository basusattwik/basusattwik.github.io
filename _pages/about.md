I am an electrical engineer with an applied research background in audio signal processing and machine learning and a passion for music. 

I will be joining the [ECE Department](https://ece.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu) as a Ph.D. student this fall. I will be advised by Professor [Romit Roy Choudhury](http://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu) at the [SyNRG](https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu) lab and work on solving problems in the field of audio using a combination of analytical DSP and data-driven models. 

I currently work as an Audio DSP Engineer at [HARMAN](https://www.harman.com) and have developed of a number of algorithms for [car audio](https://car.harman.com/solutions/car-audio) applications. Prior to that, I earned my M.S. degree in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/) with a concentration in musical acoustics and signal processing from the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu). I obtained my B.Tech degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from [SRM University, India](https://www.srmist.edu.in). 

The major research areas and projects I have worked on in the last few years include adaptive signal processing, music information retrieval and deep learning based audio processing.

When I am not working on audio, I spend most of my time listening to and playing classical piano and guitar. I have studied at the [Eastman School of Music, Community Center](https://www.esm.rochester.edu/community/) and [K.M. Music Conservatory, India](https://www.kmmc.in).
