I am a Ph.D. student in [ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). I am advised by Professor [Romit Roy Choudhury](http://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu) in the [Signals and Inference Research Group (SiNRG)](https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu). I work on problems in audio signal processing and machine learning. 

Before this, I was an Audio DSP Engineer at [HARMAN](https://www.harman.com) where I developed a number of algorithms for [car audio](https://car.harman.com/solutions/car-audio) applications. Prior to that, I earned my M.S. degree in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/) with a concentration in musical acoustics and signal processing from the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu). I obtained my B.Tech degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from [SRM University, India](https://www.srmist.edu.in). 

The major research areas and projects I have worked on in the last few years include adaptive signal processing, music information retrieval and deep learning based audio processing.

When I am not working on audio, I spend most of my time listening to and playing classical piano and guitar. I have studied at the [Eastman School of Music, Community Center](https://www.esm.rochester.edu/community/) and [K.M. Music Conservatory, India](https://www.kmmc.in).
